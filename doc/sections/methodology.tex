    Given a native outcome $w_c$, we define:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $w_{c,1990}^H$ as the native outcome in 1990 for highly educated workers.
        \item $w_{c,1990}^L$ as the native outcome in 1990 for less-educated workers.
        \item $w_{c,2000}^H$ as the native outcome in 2000 for highly educated workers.
        \item $w_{c,2000}^L$ as the native outcome in 2000 for less-educated workers.
    \end{itemize}

The dependent variable $y_c$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}
    y_c = (w_{c,2000}^H - w_{c,1990}^H) - (w_{c,2000}^L - w_{c,1990}^L)
\end{equation}

    Given the dependent variable $y_c$, we propose the following diff-in-diff model:

    \begin{equation}
        y_c = \alpha + \beta X_c + W_c' \gamma + \epsilon_c
    \end{equation}

    where $W_c$ represents the control vector defined in 1990, and $X_c$ is the endogenous variable with an instrument $Z_c$, as detailed in the previous section.
